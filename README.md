## To build

To build the site before pushing, run `gulp build`  
You must run `npm install` to install required packages for the build beforehand  
Run `gulp` to run the default task, which builds the site before starting the watch task and browsersync  
Run `gulp watch` to watch the files without first building  
Run `gulp server` to just run the browsersync server without automatic reloads
